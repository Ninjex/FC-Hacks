Enhancements / functionalities:
* Quickly identify critical shipments.

* Automatically identifies the location for outer-scannable ID's.

* Generate the total units (and if applicable, the total chutes) for a given OSID.

* Generate a modal table, for extremely useful information, such as the locations of outer-scannable ID's, prioritizing carts and totes bases on unit/chute quantity, dwelling times, and more.

* Bypass the same origin policy, and scrap data from any internal Amazon site, using the Amazon SSO.

* Customizable user settings

### What's next?

* Automatic alert functionality, when specified shipment conditions change.

* Create a class for pack stations, and auto populate stations. This will enable "smart moves", based on where work is needed the most.
